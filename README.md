# The-antenna-patterns-of-L-shaped-interferometer
 For gravitational waves observatory,  the antenna pattern functions of the detector depend on the direction from which the wave is coming.

 And this code shows how to make graphs and animations of antenna pattern functions, i.e. F_plus and F_cross.
